# Harry Taverner
## Portfolio

### Welcome

I'm a linguist and educator turned aspiring technical writer, with a background in creative writing and graphic design. I have a passion for clear communication, creative expression, and effective documentation. I create clear, engaging documentation using Markdown, Git, and GitHub Pages.

I hold a PhD in English Linguistics and have over 10 years of experience teaching and creating educational content. I’ve recently shifted focus to technical communication, combining my background in writing, research, and editing with a love for tech.  

Alongside my technical work, I also write short fiction — one story won a prize — and work with visual design.
